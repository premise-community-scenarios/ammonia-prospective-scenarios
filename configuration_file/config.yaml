# Boyce, J. C. (2022). Ammonia decarbonisation pathways and their
# effects on life cycle assessments: Integrating future ammonia scenarios
# into background data for prospective LCAs [Master’s Thesis,
# Leiden University and TU Delft].

# We have added new ammonia production routes: MP (Methane Pyrolysis),
# SMR (Steam Methane Reforming), SMRC (SMR with CCS),
# ELE (electrolysis), OIL (Partial oxidation of oil), CG (coal gasification),
# CGC (CG with CCS).
# Two hydrogen technologies: AE (alkaline electrolysis) and PEM electrolysis
# make a mini-market hydrogen, electrolysis.
# These technologies will be made specific to each IAM region,
# unless exceptions are specified.
# Markets for ammonia will be created for each IAM region and
# replace the old markets.
